# Rails Music Player

This project is my rendition of a music player without the music. While this may seem like an odd concept it was wonderful for practicing relationships as well as routes and nested routes the the complex relationships between a User, their Songs, and every way that they could access them. Maybe one day I could make a music player that actually plays music but for now this is what I have.

Install
After cloning this run bundle install then rails db:migrate to set up the database. Finally, run bin/run to start the local server and navigate to localhost:3000 to use the application.
